<i class="fa fa-archive"></i> Cache
-----------------------------------------

The `cache` remote wraps another existing remote and stores file structure
and its data for long running tasks like `rclone mount`.

To get started you just need to have an existing remote which can be configured
with `cache`.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `test-cache`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/r/c/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
...
 5 / Cache a remote
   \ "cache"
...
Storage> 5
Remote to cache.
Normally should contain a ':' and a path, eg "myremote:path/to/dir",
"myremote:bucket" or maybe "myremote:" (not recommended).
remote> local:/test
Optional: The URL of the Plex server
plex_url> http://127.0.0.1:32400
Optional: The username of the Plex user
plex_username> dummyusername
Optional: The password of the Plex user
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank
y/g/n> y
Enter the password:

The size of a chunk. Lower value good for slow connections but can affect seamless reading.
Default: 5M
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / 1MB
   \ "1m"
 2 / 5 MB
   \ "5M"
 3 / 10 MB
   \ "10M"
chunk_size> 2
How much time should object info (file size, file hashes etc) be stored in cache. Use a very high value if you don't plan on changing the source FS from outside the cache.
Accepted units are: "s", "m", "h".
Default: 5m
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / 1 hour
   \ "1h"
 2 / 24 hours
   \ "24h"
 3 / 24 hours
   \ "48h"
info_age> 2
How much time should a chunk (file data) be stored in cache.
Accepted units are: "s", "m", "h".
Default: 3h
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / 30 seconds
   \ "30s"
 2 / 1 minute
   \ "1m"
 3 / 1 hour and 30 minutes
   \ "1h30m"
The maximum size of stored chunks. When the storage grows beyond this size, the oldest chunks will be deleted.
Default: 10G
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / 500 MB
   \ "500M"
 2 / 1 GB
   \ "1G"
 3 / 10 GB
   \ "10G"
chunk_total_size> 3
Remote config
--------------------
[test-cache]
remote = local:/test
plex_url = http://127.0.0.1:32400
plex_username = dummyusername
plex_password = *** ENCRYPTED ***
chunk_size = 5M
info_age = 48h
chunk_total_size = 10G
```

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your drive

    rclone lsd test-cache:

List all the files in your drive

    rclone ls test-cache:

To start a cached mount

    rclone mount --allow-other test-cache: /var/tmp/test-cache

### Write Support ###

Writes are supported through `cache`.
One caveat is that a mounted cache remote does not add any retry or fallback
mechanism to the upload operation. This will depend on the implementation
of the wrapped remote.

One special case is covered with `cache-writes` which will cache the file
data at the same time as the upload when it is enabled making it available
from the cache store immediately once the upload is finished.

### Read Features ###

#### Multiple connections ####

To counter the high latency between a local PC where rclone is running
and cloud providers, the cache remote can split multiple requests to the
cloud provider for smaller file chunks and combines them together locally
where they can be available almost immediately before the reader usually
needs them.
This is similar to buffering when media files are played online. Rclone
will stay around the current marker but always try its best to stay ahead
and prepare the data before.

#### Plex Integration ####

There is a direct integration with Plex which allows cache to detect during reading
if the file is in playback or not. This helps cache to adapt how it queries
the cloud provider depending on what is needed for.

Scans will have a minimum amount of workers (1) while in a confirmed playback cache
will deploy the configured number of workers.

This integration opens the doorway to additional performance improvements
which will be explored in the near future.

**Note:** If Plex options are not configured, `cache` will function with its
configured options without adapting any of its settings.

How to enable? Run `rclone config` and add all the Plex options (endpoint, username
and password) in your remote and it will be automatically enabled.

Affected settings:
- `cache-workers`: _Configured value_ during confirmed playback or _1_ all the other times

### Known issues ###

#### cache and crypt ####

One common scenario is to keep your data encrypted in the cloud provider
using the `crypt` remote. `crypt` uses a similar technique to wrap around
an existing remote and handles this translation in a seamless way.

There is an issue with wrapping the remotes in this order:
<span style="color:red">**cloud remote** -> **crypt** -> **cache**</span>

During testing, I experienced a lot of bans with the remotes in this order.
I suspect it might be related to how crypt opens files on the cloud provider
which makes it think we're downloading the full file instead of small chunks.
Organizing the remotes in this order yelds better results:
<span style="color:green">**cloud remote** -> **cache** -> **crypt**</span>

### Specific options ###

Here are the command line options specific to this cloud storage
system.

#### --cache-db-path=PATH ####

Path to where partial file data (chunks) and the file structure metadata 
are stored locally.

**Default**: <rclone default config path>/<remote name>
**Example**: ~/.config/rclone/test-cache

#### --cache-db-purge ####

Flag to clear all the cached data for this remote before.

**Default**: not set

#### --cache-chunk-size=SIZE ####

The size of a chunk (partial file data). Use lower numbers for slower
connections.

**Default**: 5M

#### --cache-total-chunk-size=SIZE ####

The total size that the chunks can take up on the local disk. If `cache`
exceeds this value then it will start to the delete the oldest chunks until 
it goes under this value.

**Default**: 10G

#### --cache-chunk-clean-interval=DURATION ####

How often should `cache` perform cleanups of the chunk storage. The default value
should be ok for most people. If you find that `cache` goes over `cache-total-chunk-size`
too often then try to lower this value to force it to perform cleanups more often.

**Default**: 1m

#### --cache-info-age=DURATION ####

How long to keep file structure information (directory listings, file size, 
mod times etc) locally. 

If all write operations are done through `cache` then you can safely make
this value very large as the cache store will also be updated in real time.

**Default**: 6h

#### --cache-read-retries=RETRIES ####

How many times to retry a read from a cache storage.

Since reading from a `cache` stream is independent from downloading file data, 
readers can get to a point where there's no more data in the cache. 
Most of the times this can indicate a connectivity issue if `cache` isn't
able to provide file data anymore.

For really slow connections, increase this to a point where the stream is
able to provide data but your experience will be very stuttering. 

**Default**: 10

#### --cache-workers=WORKERS ####

How many workers should run in parallel to download chunks.

Higher values will mean more parallel processing (better CPU needed) and
more concurrent requests on the cloud provider. 
This impacts several aspects like the cloud provider API limits, more stress
on the hardware that rclone runs on but it also means that streams will 
be more fluid and data will be available much more faster to readers.

**Note**: If the optional Plex integration is enabled then this setting
will adapt to the type of reading performed and the value specified here will be used
as a maximum number of workers to use.
**Default**: 4

#### --cache-chunk-no-memory ####

By default, `cache` will keep file data during streaming in RAM as well
to provide it to readers as fast as possible.

This transient data is evicted as soon as it is read and the number of
chunks stored doesn't exceed the number of workers. However, depending
on other settings like `cache-chunk-size` and `cache-workers` this footprint
can increase if there are parallel streams too (multiple files being read
at the same time).

If the hardware permits it, use this feature to provide an overall better
performance during streaming but it can also be disabled if RAM is not
available on the local machine.

**Default**: not set

#### --cache-rps=NUMBER ####

This setting places a hard limit on the number of requests per second that `cache`
will be doing to the cloud provider remote and try to respect that value
by setting waits between reads.

If you find that you're getting banned or limited on the cloud provider
through cache and know that a smaller number of requests per second will
allow you to work with it then you can use this setting for that.

A good balance of all the other settings should make this
setting useless but it is available to set for more special cases.

**NOTE**: This will limit the number of requests during streams but other
API calls to the cloud provider like directory listings will still pass.

**Default**: 4

#### --cache-writes ####

If you need to read files immediately after you upload them through `cache`
you can enable this flag to have their data stored in the cache store at the
same time during upload.

**Default**: not set
